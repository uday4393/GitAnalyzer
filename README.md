This application lets you enter any Git Repo URL and observe metrics like No of Open Issues, etc.,

1. To run the application clone the repository from [GitAnalyzer](https://github.com/uday4393/GitAnalyzer.git)
2. Deploy app using any environment as I just implemented the functionality using ajax and Jquery.
3. After Deploying in your Dev environment, Run the app.
